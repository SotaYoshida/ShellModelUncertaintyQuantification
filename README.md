**New 0p-shell interaction: z_mass.int**  
This is the latest 0p-shell interaction for the 0p-shell in isospin-formalism.  This is optimized to the "original" 33 data set in the pioneering work by Cohen and Kurath: S. Cohen and D. Kurath, Nucl. Phys. 73, 1 (1965).  

The interaction in the input format for KSHELL is also available. -> [z_mass.snt]
